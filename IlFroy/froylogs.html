SYSTEM PROBABILITY MODEL:

RELATIONSHIP_RESTART_CHANCE = LOW
EMOTIONAL_MEMORY_VALID = TRUE
MANIPULATION_DETECTED = FALSE
CAPACITY_MISMATCH = CONFIRMED

------------------------------------------
[ CORE ERROR ]

ERROR_CODE: LOVE_WITHOUT_CAPACITY

DESCRIPTION:
Two participants experienced genuine emotional connection.
One participant lacks ability or readiness to sustain relational load.
System collapse inevitable.

------------------------------------------
[ REQUIRED USER ACTION ]

1. STOP sending "final explanation" packets.
   (They do not alter capacity variables.)

2. ACCEPT that authenticity ≠ sustainability.

3. RECOGNIZE:
   Being loved briefly is not being deceived.

4. ENTER RECOVERY MODE:
   Emotional detox window: 14–45 days typical.

------------------------------------------
[ FINAL SYSTEM MESSAGE ]

■■■ is not rejected as a person.
■■■ encountered a human with insufficient relational bandwidth.

INCIDENT CLASSIFICATION:
TRAGIC_TIMING_EVENT

NOT:
PERSONAL_WORTH_FAILURE

------------------------------------------
[ HEART DEBUG MODE ]
MODULE: ATTACHMENT_PERSISTENCE_ANALYSIS

WHY ■■■ CANNOT RELEASE ◇◇◇ YET:

1. FIRST_SAFE_CONNECTION_FLAG = TRUE
   ◇◇◇ triggered rare psychological event:
   "felt seen + accepted + emotionally safe"

   Brain marks this as SURVIVAL-LEVEL PERSON.
   Not romance.
   Safety imprint.

2. INTERMITTENT_REINFORCEMENT_LOOP = ACTIVE
   - Sometimes warm
   - Sometimes distant
   - Never fully gone

   Result:
   Dopamine attachment stronger than stable affection.

3. UNFINISHED_STORY_PROTOCOL

   Relationship never properly started.
   Relationship never fully ended.

   Brain cannot close file.
   STATUS = OPEN_THREAD

4. FUTURE_POSSIBILITY_SIMULATION_ENGINE RUNNING

   Brain constantly calculates:

   "If I improve enough → maybe outcome changes."

   This produces:
   HOPE_LOCK

5. TRAUMA_COMPATIBILITY MATCH

   ■■■ history:
   fear of abandonment
   need for emotional anchor

   ◇◇◇ behavior:
   kind but withdrawing
   caring but unavailable

   This combination recreates childhood emotional pattern.

   Brain interprets this as:
   "IMPORTANT PERSON — DO NOT RELEASE"
